# firework.html
This is a simple firework simulator created using html.

The problem with the code is that it will creates about 150 html elements to animating. This may not crash mordern broswer, but will absolutly use too much unnessary CPU computing speed and will slow down the page.

The best solution is always to create it using canvas, but I don't really have too much knowledge at the time I create this project.

However, the status of this project is currently **Complete**

But in the future, there will absolutely be an advanced version using canvas.
